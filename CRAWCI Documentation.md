# The CRAWCI project. Crime rate, Average wages and Cultural Institutions: what relationship?

Simay Guzel

## 1. Introduction

In modern theoretical approaches, the culture is considered as a value, which is connected to the quality of human’s living.  The  cultural  forms  have  been  and  are  still  used  for accomplishment of wider and bigger aims in the education, building a democratic society of strong individuals, achieving progress in all sheares of life. The presence of cultural institutions enriches and raises the quality of life , provides economic  and spiritual  reproduction.

The culture as a resource for development refers to the way of life, the wealth,  the human relationship  with others, including, for example,  labour relationship and conditions.</p>

If labour market conditions are related in an important way to crime, or individual’s intentions to commit criminal acts are altered by economic situation, then one may see the dependency of wages and crimes. At this point we are making an assumption that the level of cultural education is linked both to labour conditions of an individual as well as crime rates. Hence, our hypothesis is that the presence of cultural institutions influences crime rate and amount of salaries.</p>

## 2. Application scenario

CRAWCI aligns data from different sources in order to gain knowledge about the existence of the cultural institutions throughout italiab regions. The project looks at the relationship between the number of cultural institutions, digitalization, average salary and the number of crime reports by region in Italy.
The project aligns 1) the number of theaters; 2)the percentage of internet usage in families; 3) the number of crime reports; 4)the average salary; 5) The density of cultural institutions per square km. 

**The aims of CRAWCI Project:**
1. Creating a new mashup (final dataset) by aligning acquired datasets.
2. Producing the final dataset as a 5 star Open Data, following the principles of suggested a 5-star deployment scheme:

- Make your data available on the Web under an open license.
- Make it available as structured data (machine readable data) (e.g. Excel)
- Make it available in a non-proprietary open format (CSV)
- Use a single data model to publish data on the Web: RDF 
- Link RDF to provide context

3. Visualising the result by creating explorable and clickable map.

### 2.1 How CRAWCI can contribute to E-Governance

Advertisements and promotions among citizens to make an awareness on the importance of the presence of cultural institutions such as theaters where there are not available that can be deduced from the crime rate can be interesting for the municipalities.

  - Increase awareness
  - Opportunities for information sharing
  - Inspire public participation and collaboration  in a way that enable people to both understand what their governments do and to influence its decisions
  - Greater transparency and accountability
  - Support innovation  in processes of governance
  - Bring the delivery of public services to a new level

### D6 (Mashup)

CRAWCI Project, The final dataset, created 15 November 2019
CSV: https://github.com/simayguzel/crawci/blob/master/dataset/crawciopendata.csv
RDF: https://github.com/simayguzel/crawci/blob/master/dataset/dataset.rdf

License: 

Content description: This dataset includes1) the number of theaters; 2)the percentage of internet usage in families; 3) the number of crime reports; 4)the average salary; 5) The density of cultural institutions per square km.  The result will be a presented as an explorable map which allows users to visualize all the data about regions. 

Methodology: The mashup of datasets D1, D2, D4, D5 was done semi-automatically using Python scripts and the library Pandas, which required a CSV version of the datasets as an input. The developed script firstly dropped the unnecessary columns and then the datasets are aligned through the properties "Theaters", "AvarageIncome", "DifuseofInternet", "CriminalReports" and "CulturalInstitutions".

Here is the Python script developed to drop the columns(an example for one of the datasets):

```
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import csv
df = pd.read_csv('dataset1.csv')
df.head()
to_drop = ['PRAF',
           'RDPR',
           'Data e ora inserimento']
df.drop(to_drop, inplace=True, axis=1)

df.to_csv(r'cleaned-data1.csv', index=False)



```
Here is the Python script developed to align the datasets:
```
import pandas as pd


def Aligner(cleaned-data1,cleaned-data2,outputdata,area):
    a = pd.read_csv(cleaned-data1,encoding='utf-8')
    b = pd.read_csv(cleaned-data2,encoding='utf-8')
    aligned = a.merge(b, on=area)
    aligned.to_csv(outputdata,index=False)
```
### 4. Quality analysis of the datasets 

This section considers the necessary requirements, established according to the "Linee guida per la valorizzazione del patrimonio informativo pubblico" by AGID https://docs.italia.it/italia/daf/lg-patrimonio-pubblico/it/bozza/aspettiorg.html#qualita-dei-dati). The four characteristics to control the level of information quality are:

**accuracy** (syntactic and semantic) - the data, and its attributes, correctly represent the real value of the concept or event to which it refers;
**coherence** - the data, and its attributes, is not contradictory to other data regarding the context of use of the owner administration;
**completeness** - the data is exhaustive for all its expected values and with respect to the relative entities (sources) that contribute to the definition of the procedure;
**currentness** (or timeliness of updating) - the data, and its attributes, is of the "right time" (it is updated) with respect to the procedure to which it refers.

1. D1 makes arbitrary use of uppercase and lowercase.

2. D2 makes arbitrary use of uppercase and lowercase; unclear semantic("CRIMEN", "TERRORHOM")
3. D3 does not feature up-to-date information regarding Sardinia provinces, which changed in 2016 going from a total of 8 to a total of 4 (see Legge Regionale 4 Febbraio 2016 n.2). 
4. D4 makes arbitrary use of uppercase and lowercase, unclear semantic FAM_INT_YES, FAM_NO_ELSE, FAM_NO_USE, FAM_NO_EQUI, FAM_NO_COST, FAM_NO_SKIL, FAM_NO_SEC, FAM_NO_BROAD, FAM_NO_OTH

5. D5 makes use of integer values for indicating Comune, Provincia, Regione without a complementary explanation. 

### 5. Ethical-legal analysis

This analysis is designed to assess compliance with legal and ethical aspects in accordance with European, state and local regulations and compliance with good practices relating to publication in open data.

The analysis pays particular attention to aspects related to privacy, licenses and interest for the purpose of creating a service that balances the public function, transparency and rights of individual citizens.

The Datasets do not include any personal information of individuals since no attributes about an individual are released. Hence, an identity cannot be inferred. What is more, date-sets are not cross-referenced and not connected between other databases and datasets. We have not identified threats related to how information can be identified and connected to specific individuals.

### Licenses

D1, D2, D3 and D4 are licensed under Creative Commons License(https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/) – Attribution – 3.0 and D5 is licensed under the Open Data License (ODL) v2.0(https://opendatacommons.org/licenses/odbl/), which is very similar to a CC-BY 4.0. Each dataset is accompanied by a clear license declaration.The content of the website is covered by a "All rights reserved" copyright statement. 

Our final dataset has an open licence which allows others to republish the content or data on their own website, to derive new content or data from yours, to make money by selling products that use your content or data, to republish the content or data while charging a fee for access as long as the reusers give attribution or share-alike). Our creative work has Open Data License v2.0(https://www.dati.gov.it/content/italian-open-data-license-v20">Italian). 

### 4.3 Technical analysis (formats, metadata, URIs, provenance)

### **D1, D2, D4**

Datasets **D1, D2, D4** are available in English and Italian languages in multidimensional tables which users can export in **.xls, .csv** formats.  Default format: **Comma (,)** separated with codes and labels in separate columns.  The datasets can be can customised by choosing Text File format: **Comma ( , ); Pipe ( | ); Tabullator.**

A CSV should normally follow RFC 4180(https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4180), however, it is not followed most of the time. While analysing the CSV files of D1, D2 and D4, we have realized that each row end with ,, which does not suit to the CSV format. 

None of the datasets **D1, D2, D4**  was published in .RDF format which give us a reson to consider all the original  datasets as 3-star Open Data.

Overall, **D1, D2, D4** are very consistent, all of the follow a well-defined structure and include explanations for the abbreviations.  However, Datasets **D1, D2, D4** make arbitrary use of uppercase and lowercase. Moreover, **D2** list types of crimes in different order to different regions, which made it difficult to manipulate data while extracting necessary information. 

### **D3** 

The **D3** Dataset сan be displayed in tabular format, accessed directly through the URL or downloaded in the following distribution formats: **rdf,turle,json**.

### **D5** 

The original D5 can be downloaded as **.xlsx, .xml, .json,**  or can be exported as **CSV** which can be customised by choosing necessary columns. The dataset is also available in .RDF format but the file is damaged and cannot be opened in a proper way. 

Dataset D5 makes arbitrary use of uppercase and lowercase. Also, D5 has empty rows which lack information about theatres and makes harder data processing and data extraction.

None of the datasets was published in RDF format which give us a reson to consider all the original  datasets as 3-star Open Data.

# CSV to RDF Conversion.

### csv2rdf

To convert our data we used csv2rdf which is a Java based application, which relies on Apache Jena to convert tabular data to RDF. https://github.com/anuzzolese/csv2rdf/blob/master/README.md

The binaries can be obtained by compiling the source code with MAVEN from command line, i.e.

## Compiling

```bash 
mvn clean install
```
Once the source code have been compiled a JAR named stlab.csv2rdf-1.0.jar is available in the target folder.

## Usage

The JAR stlab.csv2rdf-1.0.jar can be used as a command line tool.
The synopsis is the following

```bash
java -jar stlab.csv2rdf-1.0.jar [OPTIONS] CSV_FILE
```

The options available are the following:

* -s,--separator &lt;char&gt;   
The character used as separator within the CSV file (e.g. , or ;).

* -m,--mapping &lt;file&gt;   
 A file providing the mapping between CSV columns and the properties of our target CRAWCI ontology.
    
 The file  contains a set of key=value lines, where each key represents a column position in the source CSV (the counting of positions starts from index 1) and each value is a pair property-datatype composed of property URI form a target ontology or vocabulary and a datatype URI. The property-datatype pairs are separated by the character '>'. The datatype is optional, hence it is possible to provide the property URI only without any datatype. We remark that if no datatype is provided, then the tool tries to infer the more appropriate datatype for the value to transform to RDF. 

 Additionally, the following file, named *mapping* and containing key=property>datatype pairs, define the mapping to be used in order to generate the properties.
 
 ```java
1. http://www.semanticweb.org/simayguzel/ontologies/2019/10/crawci#Region
2. http://www.semanticweb.org/simayguzel/ontologies/2019/10/crawci#hasTheater
3. http://www.semanticweb.org/simayguzel/ontologies/2019/10/crawci#hasAverageSalary
4. http://www.semanticweb.org/simayguzel/ontologies/2019/10/crawci#hasInternetDifusion
5. http://www.semanticweb.org/simayguzel/ontologies/2019/10/crawci#hasCriminalReport
6. http://www.semanticweb.org/simayguzel/ontologies/2019/10/crawci#hasDensity
7. http://www.semanticweb.org/simayguzel/crawci#hasCrimeLevel
9. http://www.semanticweb.org/simayguzel/crawci#hasInternetDiffusionLevel
10.http://www.semanticweb.org/simayguzel/ontologies/2019/10/crawci#hasNofTheater
11.http://www.semanticweb.org/simayguzel/crawci#hasSalaryLevel

 ``` 
 
 Hence, the following line provides the example about how to use the tool from command line in order to obtain RDF from CSV and saving its content into a file named *musicians.ttl*. We suppose that the input CSV is actually a tab-separated file.
 ```bash
 java -jar stlab.csv2rdf-1.0.jar -s '\t' -m mapping -o crawci.ttl cleandata.csv
 ```
 
 The execution of the tool with the arguments as provided produced the following RDF serialised by using the TURTLE syntax.
 

4. In the MIUR page of the csv D1 dataset there is no indication about the encoding of the file (if it's ASCII, ISO-8859-1), despite this is encouraged by the ["Linee guida per la valorizzazione del patrimonio informativo pubblico" by AGID](https://www.agid.gov.it/it/agenzia/stampa-e-comunicazione/notizie/2017/08/03/open-data-online-linee-guida-valorizzazione-del-patrimonio-informativo-pubblico). This problem can create various problems in the automatic computation of the data. In fact, a wrong encoding declaration during the analysis may create incorrect data results (some cells may be skipped for example). After trying multiple encodings, the only one that seemed to work without corrupting, using Python library "csv", was "utf-8-sig" ([see Python documentation about it here](https://docs.python.org/2/library/codecs.html#encodings-and-unicode)). An example of a script using that encoding can be seen in [section 5.1](https://github.com/sebucci/sebucci.github.io/blob/master/readme.md#51-data-processing)

### 4.4 Updating the dataset over time

We do not plan to update SEBuCCI as it takes a picture of a specific school year, namely 2016-2017. However, it would be interesting to create new datasets for the following school years to be able to make comparisons between datasets.

### 4.5 Summary

| Id | Problem description | Severity (1-3) | Type (Syntax/Semantics) | Proposed solution |
|-------------------------------|----------------------------|----------------|-------------------------|----------------------------|
| D1, D2, D4.1, D4.2 / Column A | Ambiguous date format used | 1.5 | Syntax | Adopt ISO 8601 date format |
| D1 | Indirect information about individuals | 3 | Semantics, Privacy | Remove information |
| D3, D4.3 | Incorrect information about Sardinia's provinces | 2.5 | Outdated content | Combination of manual and automatic methods to redistribute data in the correct provinces |
| D1 | Encoding of the dataset not specified | 2 | Technical | Include a note on the download page of the dataset stating its encoding |
| D1 | Ambiguity between title and content (school/institutes ID)| 2 | Semantics | Disambiguation through alignment scripts with other datasets |

## 5. Visualization

### 5.1 Data processing

Although the final dataset has been released in RDF format, the CSV has also been made available on the project GitHub repository as it was used to extract the data needed in order to produce the visualization. 

Python was used to process the CSV dataset. Each row of the CSV was converted into a list of dictionaries with the help of the "CSV" library:

```python
def process_data(source_csv_file_path):
    import csv
    data = list()
    with open(source_csv_file_path, 'r', encoding='utf-8-sig') as test:  #Notice the utf-8-sig
        processed_data = csv.DictReader(test, delimiter=',')
        for x in processed_data:
            x = dict(x)
            data.append(x)
    return data
 ```
We then developed algorithms to calculate percentages and extract data specifically useful for the final visualization.
Once the final sub-datasets that were used for computation were acquired, we used the JSON Python library to convert them into a json format as it was one of the inputs requested by the visualization library.

```python
import json
def jsonize(data,nome):
    risultatojson = open(nome+".json", "w+")  #automatically creates a json file with the name specified in the input
    json_data = json.dumps(data)  #converts the data into json format
    risultatojson.write(json_data) #writes on the new file the converted data
```

#### 5.1.1 Get school coordinates from address:

In order to get the latitude and longitude of schools knowing their addresses, we employed the following script: [address2latlon.py](https://github.com/sebucci/sebucci.github.io/blob/master/script/address2latlon.py).

It uses the library [GeoPy](https://geopy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/), which is a client for several popular geocoding web services (under [MIT license](https://github.com/geopy/geopy/blob/master/LICENSE)). Using this library we were able to retrieve geographical coordinates of schools, but only for the province of Bologna, because it has a limiter in usage, so we decided to reduce the set of schools (sebucci is still a demo).

We faced another problem here: according to our dataset we should have 430 schools, but we were able to retrieve only 298 of them. Their addresses are difficult to parse, because they are not well formed.

### 5.2 Handling the visualization (technical description)

In order to visualize the data the following libraries were used:

* **Leaflet.js**: An open-source JavaScript library for mobile-friendly interactive maps.
* **Chart.js**: Simple yet flexible JavaScript charting for designers and developers.
* **Bootstrap**: Build responsive, mobile-first projects on the web with the world's most popular front-end component library.

**GEOJSON**: Leaflet makes it possible to draw polygons directly from geojson files:

* Regions: To help us draw regions, data from [Stefano Cudini's repository](https://github.com/stefanocudini/leaflet-geojson-selector/blob/master/examples/italy-regions.json) were used.

* Provinces: To help us draw provinces, data from [Dataninja repository](https://github.com/Dataninja/geo-shapes/tree/master/italy/regions) were used.
**N.B.** Each region is contained in a single json file, except for Sardegna provinces which were not updated to 2017. In order to handle this problem, we retrieved additional data from the ISTAT archive [CONFINI DELLE UNITÀ AMMINISTRATIVE A FINI STATISTICI AL 1 GENNAIO 2018](https://www.istat.it/it/archivio/222527), [CC BY 3.0](https://www.istat.it/it/note-legali).

**Chart.js**
For the visualization of school self-evaluation a specific bar chart was chosen ([MIT license](https://www.chartjs.org/docs/latest/notes/license.html)).

### 5.3 Behind the icons (light bulbs and museum buildings)
The visualization makes use of visual metaphors to synthetically represent the data. 

#### 5.3.1 Cultural institutions
N. of cultural institutions divided by Km^2.

For Italy, each region, each province we established the following threshold:

-one museum icon if < 0.0224 (Italian average presence of cultural institutions/Km^2);
-two museum icons if >= 0.0224 and < 0.0448;
-three museum icons if >= 0.0448.

#### 5.3.2 School building safety certificates
For each school building we calculated the percentage of available certificates (for example if 4 of 8 certificates are available, then the percentage is 50%). 
For each school we calculated the average of percentages of available certificates (for example if a school has two buildings, with 25% and 50% of available certificates respectively, then the final percentage is 37.5%).

For Italy, each region, each province, each school we established the following threshold:

-red light bulb <= 33%;
-yellow light bulb > 33% and <=66%;
-green light bulb > 66%.

## 6. Final considerations

### 6.4 What about our initial questions? 

1. Does the presence of libraries, museums and other cultural institutions in school surroundings impact how schools evaluate their teaching performance? 
2. Do building certifications also play a role in school self-evaluation? 

#### Cultural institutions

By looking at the best provinces for school self-evaluation and cultural institutions per Km^2, we see that only **Rimini** and **Ascoli Piceno** appear on both lists. On this basis, we can state that **having a high number of cultural institutions nearby the school has no apparent relation with student performance**.


In the same way, by looking at the worst provinces for school self-evaluation and cultural institutions per Km^2, we see that only **Rovigo**, **Sassari**, **Nuoro** and **Sud Sardegna** appear on both lists. On this basis, we can state that **having a low number of cultural institutions nearby the school may slightly have a negative influence on student performance**.

In conclusion, **the number of cultural institutions nearby the school very slightly influence student performance**.

#### School safety certificates

By looking at the best provinces on both school self-evaluation and school safety certificates, **Rimini** and **Pordenone** are the only provinces on both lists. We can conclude that, according to our data, **having a good percentage of school safety certificates has no apparent relation with student performance**.

In the same way, by looking at the provinces having the lowest percentage of school safety certificates and the lowest school self-evaluation results, we can see that only **Nuoro**, **Trieste** and **Chieti** are included in both lists. From this, we can state that **having a bad percentage of school safety certificates has no apparent relation with student performance**.

In conclusion, **the percentage of school safety certificates do not have an apparent relation with student performance**.
